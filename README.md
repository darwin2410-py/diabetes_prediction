# diabetes_prediction

This is a project to predict diabetes disease using machine learning classification methods such as SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Random Forest Classifier yield around 89.2% and 77.9% accuracy of train and test score, with a 83% and 69% of recall score. There is a slight improvement of recall score by using hyperparameter tuning. (From 82% and 68% to 83% and 69% of recall score)
